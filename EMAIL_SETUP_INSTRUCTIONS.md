# ðŸ“§ **Add These Lines to Your `.env.local` File:**

Open your `.env.local` file and add these lines at the end:

```env
# Email Configuration for Password Reset
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
```

## ðŸ”‘ **Example:**

If your Gmail is `mbatrajpr635@gmail.com` and your App Password is `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`, add:

```env
# Email Configuration for Password Reset  
EMAIL_USER=mbatrajpr635@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
```

**Note:** Remove spaces from the App Password - use it as one continuous string.

## ðŸš€ **After Adding Credentials:**

1. **Save your `.env.local` file**
2. **Restart your development server**: Stop current server (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev` again
3. **Test forgot password**: Go to `/login` â†’ "Forgot Password?" â†’ Enter your email
4. **Check your Gmail inbox** for the password reset email!

## ðŸ“§ **The Email Will Look Like:**

```
Subject: Reset Your Password - Content Creator Platform

Hello! You requested to reset your password for Content Creator Platform.

Click the button below to reset your password:
[Reset Password Button]

Or copy and paste this link in your browser:
https://localhost:3000/reset-password?token=...

This link will expire in 1 hour for security reasons.

If you didn't request this password reset, please ignore this email.
```

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting:**

If emails still don't arrive:

1. **Check Gmail App Password is correct** (16 characters, no spaces)
2. **Check spam folder** in Gmail
3. **Verify 2-Step Verification is enabled** on your Google Account
4. **Try using your actual Gmail password** first (less secure but for testing)

The system will work with both console URLs (development) and real emails (production)!
